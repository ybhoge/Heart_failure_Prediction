# Heart_failure_Prediction
   Data Science Project to assess the likelihood of a death event by heart failure.Heart failure is one of the most common causes of death. Those affected often aren't aware they are at risk. With this program, we try to show people whether it is likely that they will develop heart failure. Hopefully, the program can stimulate more people to go see a doctor when necessary. This might result in fewer deaths caused by heart failure.
