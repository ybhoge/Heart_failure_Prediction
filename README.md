# Heart_failure_Prediction
   Data Science Project to assess the likelihood of a death event by heart failure.Heart failure is one of the most common causes of death. Those affected often aren't aware they are at risk. With this program, we try to show people whether it is likely that they will develop heart failure. Hopefully, the program can stimulate more people to go see a doctor when necessary. This might result in fewer deaths caused by heart failure.

# Dataset
  The dataset contains medical records of 299 patients who had heart failure, collected during their follow-up period, where each patient profile has 13 clinical features.

Age

Anaemia

Creatinine Phosphokinase

Diabetes

Ejection Fraction

High Blood Pressure

Platelets

Serum Creatinine

Serum Sodium

Sex

Smoking

# Model
Model training: Created various models like:

   1)Random Forest Classification Model

   2)Decision Tree Classifier

   3)Logistic Classifier

   4)Naive Byes 

   5)SVC

and other classification models and fitted the train & test data to each model.
